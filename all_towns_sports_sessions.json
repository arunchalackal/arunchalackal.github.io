The Lexington Recreation and Community Programs Department is excited to continue its partnership with PlayLocal , www.playlocal.com , in 2025! Beginning on February 25 th , Tennis and Pickleball memberships may be purchased online. COURT RESERVATION RULES & GUIDELINES Courts are available for reservations seven days per week, 8:00am-8:00pm from April 1, 2025 – November 23, 2025. There are 10 lighted courts at the Gallagher Courts available for night play with a paid reservation until 9:00pm ( reservations must be made by 12:00pm on the day of the reservation )! Court reservations may be made up to 2 weeks in advance and the PlayLocal system will launch for the 2025 season on Tuesday, March 18th. A person may make only 1 reservation (1 hour/1 court) for any given day. NEW FOR 2025 - courts will go live on PlayLocal on a rolling basis throughout the season, two weeks before the reservation time . For example, if you want to reserve a court at 9:00am on Tuesday, April 15th, you will be able to reserve the court as of Tuesday, April 1st at 9:00am. Similarly, if you want to reserve a court at 5:00pm on Thursday, April 17th, you will be able to reserve the court as of Thursday, April 3rd at 5:00pm. This enhancement will prevent people from having to wake up early at 6:00am to make court reservations, which will make the experience more enjoyable and convenient for court users! Adams #1 and Adams #2, along with Clarke #3, will be reservable for pickleball play only . The Valley Courts will be reconstructed this year and it is anticipated that these courts will be offline from May-August 2025. If you arrive more than 15 minutes late to your reservation, you forfeit use of the court for the entire hour. Once you make a reservation, if you are no longer available at that time, please be sure to cancel your reservation ahead of time. Your consideration for fellow tennis/pickleball players is greatly appreciated. No refunds are given. Rain checks will be issued.

If you would like to add your name to the waitlist, please contact Peter Coleman at pcoleman@lexingtonma.gov . Online Court Reservations in Lexington! The Lexington Recreation and Community Programs Department is excited to continue its partnership with PlayLocal , www.playlocal.com , in 2025! Beginning on February 25 th , Tennis and Pickleball memberships may be purchased online. COURT RESERVATION RULES & GUIDELINES Courts are available for reservations seven days per week, 8:00am-8:00pm from April 1, 2025 – November 23, 2025. There are 10 lighted courts at the Gallagher Courts available for night play with a paid reservation until 9:00pm ( reservations must be made by 12:00pm on the day of the reservation )! Court reservations may be made up to 2 weeks in advance and the PlayLocal system will launch for the 2025 season on Tuesday, March 18th. A person may make only 1 reservation (1 hour/1 court) for any given day. NEW FOR 2025 - courts will go live on PlayLocal on a rolling basis throughout the season, two weeks before the reservation time . For example, if you want to reserve a court at 9:00am on Tuesday, April 15th, you will be able to reserve the court as of Tuesday, April 1st at 9:00am. Similarly, if you want to reserve a court at 5:00pm on Thursday, April 17th, you will be able to reserve the court as of Thursday, April 3rd at 5:00pm. This enhancement will prevent people from having to wake up early at 6:00am to make court reservations, which will make the experience more enjoyable and convenient for court users! Adams #1 and Adams #2, along with Clarke #3, will be reservable for pickleball play only . The Valley Courts will be reconstructed this year and it is anticipated that these courts will be offline from May-August 2025.

The In-Town Basketball League is an organized recreational basketball program for boys and girls currently enrolled in grades 5-12. This season there will be 4 leagues: Girls 5th-8th Grade League Co-ed 5th/6th Grade League Co-ed 7th/8th Grade League Co-ed High School League is a mix of 9th-12th graders There will be a weekly 55 min practice for each team during the week and a 1 hour game on Saturday afternoons. Practice and game times will vary throughout the season and take place at either Clarke or Diamond Middle School. You will receive the specific dates and times of all scheduled practices and games for the league before the season begins. Our leagues utilize the TeamSnap app for scheduling and team communications.  Families will be invited to join the app prior to the start of the season. For the Girls 5th-8th Grade, Co-ed 5th/6th Grade and Co-ed 7th/8th Grade Leagues there will be a Meet and Greet prior to the start of practices/games where players will meet their team mates and coaches.  For the the High School League there will be Draft/Team Formation Night where players will scrimmage and will be selected to teams. Minimal adjustments to player team assignments may be made at the start of the season in an effort to have balanced teams. Meet and Greet and High School Draft dates/times: Tentatively moving to the week of December 15th.  Please visit our website for updates. We will need volunteer coaches for all leagues. You can review our coaching requirements on our website: https://www.lexingtonma.gov/2237/Volunteer-Coaching If you are available and interested, please be sure to check that section off in the Q&A's or reach out to Laura Perry at LPerry@lexingtonma.gov . All of our leagues will hold all participants, volunteers, and spectators accountable to our code of conduct for the program. We will have a ZERO tolerance for behavior unbefitting.

Sportsmanship is paramount at our tournament.  The tournament is held at the Newton South High School and uses 2 gyms for tournament play.  Both gyms are hardwood floor basketball courts and lined with green tape.  Additional warm up courts are available on a rubberized surface. Our tournament offers divisions for B, C and now D level players, and beginner and intermediate youth.  Be sure to register for the appropriate division for your level of play.  Please understand that A level players and advanced youth are not allowed in our tournament, but are welcome to come and watch. Ages are determined by calendar year, so your age for the tournament is the age you will be on December 31, 2026. Please Note: Because of time constraints we limit the number of divisions that a person can register for. B, C & D level players may register for 1 single and 1 double division on Saturday and 1 mixed double division on Sunday.  Youth ages14 and older (born 2012 or earlier) may play in the Open or Youth division, but not both.  Youth division players may sign up for 1 single and 1 double division on Sunday. This year’s tournament will have single elimination and round robin games.  Single elimination games will play best of 3 games to 21 points. Round robin games will play best of 3 games to 15 points and play each team in their bracket. Consolation games for single elimination divisions will play 1 game to 31 points.  Please see the Tournament Flyer for more details Registration Information: Everyone playing in the tournament must register online and sign the waiver. Divisions are limited so register early to guarantee your space.  Registration closes February 27th or when the division is full.  Refunds will only be issued if we can fill the space.  Be sure to register for the appropriate division.  Players registered for the incorrect division will be moved to the appropriate division if space allows, or will have their entries cancelled. * For singles divisions, each person playing must register for their division. * For doubles divisions, one team member will register for the division, list their team member, and pay the fee.  The other team member will need to register in the doubles partners sign up for the appropriate day to fill out their information and sign the waiver. * It is ok for a lower level player to play \"up\" in a division, but higher level players can not play down a level.  For example, in doubles, a C or D level player may play up in the B doubles division with a B level partner, but the B level player can not play down in the C or D doubles (with the exception of the B/C mixed doubles which is meant for this situation).  Please choose your partners accordingly. * Register early as divisions have filled in previous years. * Any changes to partners must be approved prior to the start of the tournament. Youth Divisions: The youth single age groups and youth double beginner division are meant for players in their first couple of years of playing and competing in badminton tournaments.  If youth are more advanced than peers in their age group, have several years of consistent experience, have attended several competitions or are ranked, have won our tournament in previous years, or are ready for more of a challenge, they should play in the intermediate division. We do not have an advanced youth division, but if youth are 14 or older they can play in the open division in the B or C level.  Age eligible youth may not compete in both the youth and open division, they must pick one or the other.

Sportsmanship is paramount at our tournament.  The tournament is held at the Newton South High School and uses 2 gyms for tournament play.  Both gyms are hardwood floor basketball courts and lined with green tape.  Additional warm up courts are available on a rubberized surface. Our tournament offers divisions for B, C and now D level players, and beginner and intermediate youth.  Be sure to register for the appropriate division for your level of play.  Please understand that A level players and advanced youth are not allowed in our tournament, but are welcome to come and watch. Ages are determined by calendar year, so your age for the tournament is the age you will be on December 31, 2026. Please Note: Because of time constraints we limit the number of divisions that a person can register for. B, C & D level players may register for 1 single and 1 double division on Saturday and 1 mixed double division on Sunday.  Youth ages14 and older (born 2012 or earlier) may play in the Open or Youth division, but not both.  Youth division players may sign up for 1 single and 1 double division on Sunday. This year’s tournament will have single elimination and round robin games.  Single elimination games will play best of 3 games to 21 points. Round robin games will play best of 3 games to 15 points and play each team in their bracket. Consolation games for single elimination divisions will play 1 game to 31 points.  Please see the Tournament Flyer for more details Registration Information: Everyone playing in the tournament must register online and sign the waiver. Divisions are limited so register early to guarantee your space.  Registration closes February 27th or when the division is full.  Refunds will only be issued if we can fill the space.  Be sure to register for the appropriate division.  Players registered for the incorrect division will be moved to the appropriate division if space allows, or will have their entries cancelled. * For singles divisions, each person playing must register for their division. * For doubles divisions, one team member will register for the division, list their team member, and pay the fee.  The other team member will need to register in the doubles partners sign up for the appropriate day to fill out their information and sign the waiver. * It is ok for a lower level player to play \"up\" in a division, but higher level players can not play down a level.  For example, in doubles, a C or D level player may play up in the B doubles division with a B level partner, but the B level player can not play down in the C or D doubles (with the exception of the B/C mixed doubles which is meant for this situation).  Please choose your partners accordingly. * Register early as divisions have filled in previous years. * Any changes to partners must be approved prior to the start of the tournament. Youth Divisions: The youth single age groups and youth double beginner division are meant for players in their first couple of years of playing and competing in badminton tournaments.  If youth are more advanced than peers in their age group, have several years of consistent experience, have attended several competitions or are ranked, have won our tournament in previous years, or are ready for more of a challenge, they should play in the intermediate division. We do not have an advanced youth division, but if youth are 14 or older they can play in the open division in the B or C level.  Age eligible youth may not compete in both the youth and open division, they must pick one or the other.

Sportsmanship is paramount at our tournament.  The tournament is held at the Newton South High School and uses 2 gyms for tournament play.  Both gyms are hardwood floor basketball courts and lined with green tape.  Additional warm up courts are available on a rubberized surface. Our tournament offers divisions for B, C and now D level players, and beginner and intermediate youth.  Be sure to register for the appropriate division for your level of play.  Please understand that A level players and advanced youth are not allowed in our tournament, but are welcome to come and watch. Ages are determined by calendar year, so your age for the tournament is the age you will be on December 31, 2026. Please Note: Because of time constraints we limit the number of divisions that a person can register for. B, C & D level players may register for 1 single and 1 double division on Saturday and 1 mixed double division on Sunday.  Youth ages14 and older (born 2012 or earlier) may play in the Open or Youth division, but not both.  Youth division players may sign up for 1 single and 1 double division on Sunday. This year’s tournament will have single elimination and round robin games.  Single elimination games will play best of 3 games to 21 points. Round robin games will play best of 3 games to 15 points and play each team in their bracket. Consolation games for single elimination divisions will play 1 game to 31 points.  Please see the Tournament Flyer for more details Registration Information: Everyone playing in the tournament must register online and sign the waiver. Divisions are limited so register early to guarantee your space.  Registration closes February 27th or when the division is full.  Refunds will only be issued if we can fill the space.  Be sure to register for the appropriate division.  Players registered for the incorrect division will be moved to the appropriate division if space allows, or will have their entries cancelled. * For singles divisions, each person playing must register for their division. * For doubles divisions, one team member will register for the division, list their team member, and pay the fee.  The other team member will need to register in the doubles partners sign up for the appropriate day to fill out their information and sign the waiver. * It is ok for a lower level player to play \"up\" in a division, but higher level players can not play down a level.  For example, in doubles, a C or D level player may play up in the B doubles division with a B level partner, but the B level player can not play down in the C or D doubles (with the exception of the B/C mixed doubles which is meant for this situation).  Please choose your partners accordingly. * Register early as divisions have filled in previous years. * Any changes to partners must be approved prior to the start of the tournament. Youth Divisions: The youth single age groups and youth double beginner division are meant for players in their first couple of years of playing and competing in badminton tournaments.  If youth are more advanced than peers in their age group, have several years of consistent experience, have attended several competitions or are ranked, have won our tournament in previous years, or are ready for more of a challenge, they should play in the intermediate division. We do not have an advanced youth division, but if youth are 14 or older they can play in the open division in the B or C level.  Age eligible youth may not compete in both the youth and open division, they must pick one or the other.

    "details": "2026 Badminton Tournament - March 14 & 15, 2026 • Register • View Cart • This tournament is hosted by Newton Parks and Recreation and promotes a love for the sport of badminton. Sportsmanship is paramount at our tournament.  The tournament is held at the Newton South High School and uses 2 gyms for tournament play.  Both gyms are hardwood floor basketball courts and lined with green tape.  Additional warm up courts are available on a rubberized surface. Our tournament offers divisions for B, C and now D level players, and beginner and intermediate youth.  Be sure to register for the appropriate division for your level of play.  Please understand that A level players and advanced youth are not allowed in our tournament, but are welcome to come and watch. Ages are determined by calendar year, so your age for the tournament is the age you will be on December 31, 2026. Please Note: Because of time constraints we limit the number of divisions that a person can register for. B, C & D level players may register for 1 single and 1 double division on Saturday and 1 mixed double division on Sunday.  Youth ages14 and older (born 2012 or earlier) may play in the Open or Youth division, but not both.  Youth division players may sign up for 1 single and 1 double division on Sunday. This year’s tournament will have single elimination and round robin games.  Single elimination games will play best of 3 games to 21 points. Round robin games will play best of 3 games to 15 points and play each team in their bracket. Consolation games for single elimination divisions will play 1 game to 31 points.  Please see the Tournament Flyer for more details Registration Information: Everyone playing in the tournament must register online and sign the waiver. Divisions are limited so register early to guarantee your space.  Registration closes February 27th or when the division is full.  Refunds will only be issued if we can fill the space.  Be sure to register for the appropriate division.  Players registered for the incorrect division will be moved to the appropriate division if space allows, or will have their entries cancelled. * For singles divisions, each person playing must register for their division. * For doubles divisions, one team member will register for the division, list their team member, and pay the fee.  The other team member will need to register in the doubles partners sign up for the appropriate day to fill out their information and sign the waiver. * It is ok for a lower level player to play \"up\" in a division, but higher level players can not play down a level.  For example, in doubles, a C or D level player may play up in the B doubles division with a B level partner, but the B level player can not play down in the C or D doubles (with the exception of the B/C mixed doubles which is meant for this situation).  Please choose your partners accordingly. * Register early as divisions have filled in previous years. * Any changes to partners must be approved prior to the start of the tournament. Youth Divisions: The youth single age groups and youth double beginner division are meant for players in their first couple of years of playing and competing in badminton tournaments.  If youth are more advanced than peers in their age group, have several years of consistent experience, have attended several competitions or are ranked, have won our tournament in previous years, or are ready for more of a challenge, they should play in the intermediate division. We do not have an advanced youth division, but if youth are 14 or older they can play in the open division in the B or C level.  Age eligible youth may not compete in both the youth and open division, they must pick one or the other.

Classes at Cabot School run in the Fall and Spring on Saturdays and include 3 full sized hard wood floor courts. Classes at Newton South Recreation Complex run in the Winter on Sundays in the field house and use 3 hardwood floor courts and 1 rubber court.

Because of the scheduling of classes and limited time availability, make-ups are not offered for this program if you need to miss a class. What do the ball colors mean? Red Ball: 19/21-inch rackets are used with red felt balls.  This means children can control the ball and racket, develop proper swing technique and get a real sense of playing the game. Orange Ball: 21/23-inch rackets are used with an orange ball that is lower compression that travels a little faster and farther than the red ball.  Players are taught proper technique for all strokes-focusing on ground stroke development, net play and serving. Footwork and beginning level of basic strategy – how to keep score and rally. Green Ball: 25/27 inch rackets are used.  The green ball has less pressure than the standard yellow ball (75% pressure) and easier to hit.  This stage is for players that can rally, volley and beginning to understand strategy and tactics. Yellow Ball: Is designed for high school and adult competitive players.  Designed for players that have the ability and strength to use a standard size tennis ball.

Because of the scheduling of classes and limited time availability, make-ups are not offered for this program if you need to miss a class. What do the ball colors mean? Red Ball: 19/21-inch rackets are used with red felt balls.  This means children can control the ball and racket, develop proper swing technique and get a real sense of playing the game. Orange Ball: 21/23-inch rackets are used with an orange ball that is lower compression that travels a little faster and farther than the red ball.  Players are taught proper technique for all strokes-focusing on ground stroke development, net play and serving. Footwork and beginning level of basic strategy – how to keep score and rally. Green Ball: 25/27 inch rackets are used.  The green ball has less pressure than the standard yellow ball (75% pressure) and easier to hit.  This stage is for players that can rally, volley and beginning to understand strategy and tactics. Yellow Ball: Is designed for high school and adult competitive players.  Designed for players that have the ability and strength to use a standard size tennis ball.

Red Ball: 19/21-inch rackets are used with red felt balls.  This means children can control the ball and racket, develop proper swing technique and get a real sense of playing the game. Orange Ball: 21/23-inch rackets are used with an orange ball that is lower compression that travels a little faster and farther than the red ball.  Players are taught proper technique for all strokes-focusing on ground stroke development, net play and serving. Footwork and beginning level of basic strategy – how to keep score and rally. Green Ball: 25/27 inch rackets are used.  The green ball has less pressure than the standard yellow ball (75% pressure) and easier to hit.  This stage is for players that can rally, volley and beginning to understand strategy and tactics. Yellow Ball: Is designed for high school and adult competitive players.  Designed for players that have the ability and strength to use a standard size tennis ball.

Because of the scheduling of classes and limited time availability, make-ups are not offered for this program if you need to miss a class. What do the ball colors mean? Red Ball: 19/21-inch rackets are used with red felt balls.  This means children can control the ball and racket, develop proper swing technique and get a real sense of playing the game. Orange Ball: 21/23-inch rackets are used with an orange ball that is lower compression that travels a little faster and farther than the red ball.  Players are taught proper technique for all strokes-focusing on ground stroke development, net play and serving. Footwork and beginning level of basic strategy – how to keep score and rally. Green Ball: 25/27 inch rackets are used.  The green ball has less pressure than the standard yellow ball (75% pressure) and easier to hit.  This stage is for players that can rally, volley and beginning to understand strategy and tactics.
